# Google Data Analytics: Capstone Project
### Cyclistic Bike Share

## Project Overview
A fictional bike-sharing company, **Cyclistic**, has hypothesized that maximizing the number of annual members, versus casual riders, is the key to their future growth. In order to build a new marketing strategy aimed to convert casual riders into annual members, the marketing analyst tems wants to know:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would causal riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I will be answering the first question.
