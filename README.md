# Google Data Analytics: Capstone Project
### Cyclistic Bike Share

## Project Overview
A fictional bike-sharing company, **Cyclistic**, has hypothesized that maximizing the number of annual members, versus casual riders, is the key to their future growth. In order to build a new marketing strategy aimed to convert casual riders into annual members, the marketing analyst tems wants to know:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would causal riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I will be answering the first question using the 6 steps of data analysis taught in the Google Data Analytics course; ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.


## Ask
  
The Cyclistic executive team is concerned with maximizing their future growth as a company. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, is concerned with ensuring this growth by creating a marketing strategy designed to convert casual riders of Cyclistic into annual members. The marketing analytics team, which I am a member of, are concered with using our data to answer the three above questions, and use the answers to guide the marketing program.  
  
The current task is to analyze the data and identify key behavioural differences between casual riders and annual members in order to present reccomended next steps to the company.  
  
## Prepare
